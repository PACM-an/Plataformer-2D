Hi!
This repository presents the code for a personal project about a 2D platformer game.

The game is offered in two forms: code version or executable.
The game is made in GameMaker Studio, so it needs to be run in this application if you want to view the code.
In the other case, it is an installable, so it requires prior game installation.
